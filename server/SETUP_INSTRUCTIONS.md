# Sentiment Analysis Setup Instructions

## Current Status ✅

**✅ COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Sentiment analysis module created (`sentiment_analysis.py`)
- ✅ Groq API integration working perfectly
- ✅ Enhanced recommendation algorithm implemented
- ✅ Database schema migration prepared
- ✅ API endpoints for sentiment management added
- ✅ Test suite created and validated
- ✅ Dependencies updated (Groq v0.29.0)

**⚠️ PENDING:**
- ⚠️ Database connection configuration
- ⚠️ Database migration execution

## Test Results

### ✅ Groq API Testing (SUCCESSFUL)
```
✅ API connection successful!
✅ Sentiment analysis working correctly:
  - Positive comments: 80-90% positive sentiment
  - Negative comments: 80% negative sentiment  
  - Neutral comments: 100% neutral sentiment
✅ Sentiment weighting calculation working
✅ Rate limiting and caching implemented
```

### ❌ Database Connection (NEEDS SETUP)
```
❌ Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
```

## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Configure Database Connection

Edit the `.env` file with your MySQL credentials:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_mysql_password
DB_NAME=lawfort
DB_POOL_SIZE=5
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

**Replace `your_actual_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL root password.**

### 2. Run Database Migration

After configuring the database connection, run:

```bash
python run_migration.py
```

This will add the following columns to the `Content_Metrics` table:
- `Sentiment_Score` - Overall sentiment (-1.00 to 1.00)
- `Positive_Ratio` - Positive sentiment ratio
- `Negative_Ratio` - Negative sentiment ratio  
- `Neutral_Ratio` - Neutral sentiment ratio
- `Sentiment_Confidence` - Analysis confidence
- `Overall_Sentiment` - Classification (positive/negative/neutral)
- `Sentiment_Last_Updated` - Last analysis timestamp
- `Sentiment_Comment_Count` - Number of comments analyzed

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

## How the Enhanced Recommendation System Works

### 1. Comment Analysis
When users add comments to blog posts:
1. Comment text is sent to Groq API for sentiment analysis
2. Returns sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral)
3. Results are cached for 24 hours

### 2. Blog Post Sentiment Aggregation
For each blog post:
1. All active comments are analyzed
2. Sentiment scores are aggregated using simple statistical methods
3. Overall sentiment and confidence calculated
4. Results stored in database

### 3. Enhanced Recommendation Scoring
When sorting by engagement:
```
Base engagement = likes + comments
Sentiment weight = 1.0 + (sentiment_score × confidence × 0.5)
Final score = base_engagement × sentiment_weight
```

**Impact:**
- Positive sentiment: Up to +50% boost (1.5x multiplier)
- Negative sentiment: Up to -50% penalty (0.5x multiplier)
- Neutral/low confidence: No change (1.0x multiplier)

### 4. API Endpoints Added

```
GET /api/content/{id}/sentiment - Get sentiment data
POST /api/content/{id}/sentiment/update - Trigger analysis
POST /api/admin/sentiment/batch-update - Batch update (admin)
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Sentiment Analysis
```bash
python test_sentiment.py
```

### 2. Test Enhanced Recommendations
1. Create blog posts with comments
2. Add positive comments to one post
3. Add negative comments to another post
4. Check engagement-sorted results - positive posts should rank higher

### 3. Monitor Sentiment Updates
Check logs for sentiment analysis activities:
```
INFO:sentiment_analysis:Updated sentiment for content 123: positive (score: 0.75)
```

## Configuration Options

### Rate Limiting
- Minimum 1 second between API requests
- Automatic retry logic for failed requests

### Caching
- Sentiment results cached for 24 hours
- Cache invalidated when comment count changes

### Confidence Thresholds
- Minimum 2 comments required for sentiment weighting
- Minimum 0.1 confidence required for sentiment consideration

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify MySQL is running
2. Check username/password in `.env`
3. Ensure `lawfort` database exists
4. Test connection: `mysql -u root -p lawfort`

### Groq API Issues
1. Check API key validity
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Monitor rate limiting

### Sentiment Not Updating
1. Check if comments exist and are active
2. Verify sentiment update triggers in logs
3. Manually trigger: `POST /api/content/{id}/sentiment/update`

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `sentiment_analysis.py` - Core sentiment analysis module
- `sentiment_migration.sql` - Database schema enhancement
- `test_sentiment.py` - Test suite
- `run_migration.py` - Migration runner
- `SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_README.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files:
